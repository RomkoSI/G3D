GLG3DVR.lib is experimental support for consumer VR HMDs. It currently supports 
only Oculus DK2. As soon as other hardware is widely available, we will extend 
the API.

This library is only supported on Windows.

Building GLG3DVR requires installing the Oculus SDK, setting an OVRSDKROOT environment variable
and setting your VC++ Include Directories:

- $(OVRSDKROOT)\LibOVRKernel\Src;$(OVRSDKROOT)\LibOVR\Include;$(IncludePath)

GLG3DVR provides pre-compiled binaries of the Oculus SDK .lib files for ovr and ovrkernel because
the ones provided by Oculus are not compatible with VS 2015 or the multithreaded runtime. You 
can build your own binaries for these from the Oculus-distributed sources.

(This library is not called VRGLG3D because there is already a VRG3D library for CAVE-like VR.)
