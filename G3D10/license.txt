The G3D Innovation Engine Core Components (G3D.lib, GLG3D.lib, and data-files/shader) 
are open source under the OSI-approved "Modified BSDF" license. It is distributed 
alongside several other libraries and data files that each have their own licenses.
The contents of each subdirectory tree in the G3D Innovation Engine source tree 
and distribution are governed by the "license.txt" or "license" file at the root of
that tree.

Note that the G3D Innovation Engine does not and cannot grant a license to these 
other libraries. Your use of those libraries is governed by their own licenses,
which the library maintainers believe but do not warrant are suitable for research,
academic, open source, and independent game developer use without further licensing
arrangements and are amenable to large-scale commercial development with further 
licensing arrangements. 

Commercial usage of FMOD products may require a separate license directly with Firelight Technologies. For details refer to www.fmod.com/files/public/LICENSE.TXT.
Unless you exclude FMOD Studio from the G3D build using the G3D_NO_FMOD macro
at compile time, you must credit "FMOD" (or "FMOD STUDIO") and "FIRELIGHT TECHNOLOGIES"
in your product in documentation, or in an on screen format.

The redistributed libraries include:

* assimp    - BSD-style open source
* ATLAS     - BSD-style open source
* Ceres     - BSD-style open source
* civetweb  - BSD-style open source
* zip       - BSD-style open source
* zlib      - BSD-style open source
* fmod      - FMOD Sound System, copyright (C) Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd., 1994-2014.
* FreeImage - FreeImage Public License - Version 1.0
* ffMPEG    - GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1
* qrencode  - GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1

The non-BSD-style components can be excluded from the G3D build using the G3D_NO_XXX 
macros. qrencode.lib is not linked to G3D.

Content under data-files (excluding the shader subtree) are governed by a mixture of Creative Commons licenses and Public Domain.

As a convenience, the G3D Innovation Engine produces the file g3d-license.txt
for any program linked against it that contains the statemens listed below, which
may aid developers in complying with the licenses of the distributed libraries. 
However, it is the sole responsibility of the application developer to comply with
these licenses and satisfy licensing arrangements.
