 Tesselates a complex polygon into a triangle set which is appended
 to the output.  The input is a series of counter-clockwise winding
 vertices, where the last is implicitly connected to the first.
 Self-intersections are allowed; "inside" is determined by an "odd"
 winding rule.  You may need to introduce a sliver polygon to cut
 holes out of the center.
