This directory contains a redistribution of the FMOD Studio API, which
the G3D Innovation Engine uses to implement cross-platform audio.
Redistribution is in accordance with a licensing agreement signed between
Firelight Technologies Pty Ltd and Morgan McGuire and 2014-05-15.

FMOD Studio can be downloaded from http://www.fmod.org.

Usage of the FMOD Studio API by programmers using the G3D Innovation Engine
to build their own applications is governed by the FMOD license in fmod/LICENSE.tXT
in the same directory as this file. If your application does not use audio,
FMOD does not support your platform, or you do not agree to be bound by the 
FMOD license, then you must exclude FMOD from the G3D build by defining the
G3D_NO_FMOD macro when compiling G3D and your application. That macro directs the
compiler to not use or link against FMOD.

Commercial usage of FMOD products may require a separate license directly with Firelight Technologies. For details refer to www.fmod.com/files/public/LICENSE.TXT
