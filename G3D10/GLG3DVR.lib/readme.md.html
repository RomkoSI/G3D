GLG3DVR.lib is experimental support for consumer VR HMDs. It currently supports 
HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Oculus DK2.

This library is only supported on Windows.

GLG3DVR provides pre-compiled binaries of the OpenVR .lib files and the OpenVR SDK. You do
not need to install those. You do need to install Valve's free Steam client.

(This library is not called VRGLG3D because there is already an open source VRG3D library for CAVE-like VR.)
