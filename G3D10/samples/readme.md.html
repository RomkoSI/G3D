Many of the programs in this directory require the g3d/data10/common 
asset pack to be installed from Subversion.

To run your G3D programs on computers without G3D installed, 
include all of the assets that they require in their data-files
directories, or put those assets in a file named data.zip in the
same directory as the executable.  

You will also need to redistribute the .dll files from the
G3D/bin directory on Windows.  On OS X, distribute all of the
.dylib files that iCompile puts in your build directory.
