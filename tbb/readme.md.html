**Intel Threading Building Blocks Library 4.4 Update 5**

Downloaded from https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/download

The library is open source and can be built from source; we are
temporarily using the binary distribution in G3D while working
on integration.

TBB has the same license as GNU libstdc++. It is GPL2 with an exception
to prevent it from virally infecting the license of the program
that links against it (this appears to be the same as the intent of the
LGPL license.)
