  \brief A 3D perspective projection with bounding planes in camera space.

  The area that a computer graphics camera sees is called a frustum.  It is bounded by the
  near plane, the far plane, and the sides of the view frame projected
  into the scene.  It has the shape of a pyramid with the top cut off.

  Cameras can project points from 3D to 2D.  The "unit" projection
  matches OpenGL.  It maps the entire view frustum to a cube of unit
  radius (i.e., edges of length 2) centered at the origin.  The
  non-unit projection then maps that cube to the specified pixel
  viewport in X and Y and the range [0, 1] in Z.  The projection is
  reversable as long as the projected Z value is known.

  All viewport arguments are the pixel bounds of the viewport-- e.g.,
  RenderDevice::viewport().

  See http://bittermanandy.wordpress.com/2009/04/10/a-view-to-a-thrill-part-one-camera-concepts/
  for a nice introduction to camera transformations.
